# Simple-neural-network
Simple neural network with using sigmoid function as activation function.

The program is written to understand the general algorithm of the neural networks. The program doesn't use ready-made libraries.
The neuron multiplies the input data by their respective weights, and summarizes this data. The resulting list is passed to the activator function.
As the activator function i used the sigmoid function.
